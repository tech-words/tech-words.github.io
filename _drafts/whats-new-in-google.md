title: What's new in Google
---

@annstanley (iabuk.net) told us at [Second Wednesday](MAKE A LINK) about what's new in Google:

- Local results push down organic results - also appear on map on right
- Product listings now paid - but fantastic advertising
- Authorship makes a lot of difference - do it!
- Rich snippets
  > event dates
  > addresses
  > movie listings
  > etc.
- "knowledge graph" - answering questions themselves (like "how many people live in England")
  > uses session info to contextualise your search
- Google are working to make it so you don't need to click through - they want Google to be your only portal!
- Google Now - new advertising opportunity - local listings
- Voice search (a bit useless)
- Google+ has SEO benefits by providing links for commenting on MattCutts' page
- Google+ dashboard
- Google "penguin" update (April last year) - about spammy links - penalisation for link farming
- Google penguin 2 in the last two weeks. Some "black hat" examples:
  > advertorials (paid fake comments)
  > sites with little content just for links
  > penalised for "slow" and "unresponsive"
- clean up your act by clicking "disavow" - helps Google crowd-source spammy sites
- To keep up with Google stuff use "feedly" and "flipboard"
- 22nd July - all ad campaigns switch to "enhanced campaigns"
  > All ad campaigns are now across all devices whether you like it or not
  > Helps you track people across devices through their Google account
  > Call tracking - see how many people phoned from Google
- Ad prices are going to go up because of this "enhancement"
- You can now customise ad-words by device - lower for mobile. You want to make it lower for mobiles.
- Can use "get updates" to sign up people to mailing list really quickly
- Star ratings will be included in adverts if they're higher than about 4.5/5
- Quality score / relevancy for your adword terms make your ads much cheaper
  > Means you normally get good placements for your own brand name ("diet chef")
- Images above text ads

Mobile:
- "50-60% of local searches are on Mobile"
- Call direct from Google - it used to cost, now it's free
- "google local" is part of Google+ - your business needs to have a Google+ account

Adwords:

Analytics:
- Can use Google Ad Services JS to input how much money something costs - for AdWords analytics

Questions
---

- Doesn't Google+ use "nofollow" on comments?
- Any idea how they tell if something is "responsive"?
