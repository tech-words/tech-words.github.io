Performance summary
===

I was motivated to work hard and long hours on the new Arena website project. I picked up C# fairly easily and felt I had a lot of positive input into the project, and I'm proud of what we produced.

For web-blinds.com, I have learned a lot about how Magento works and I've done some useful work on the BAU backlog tasks. However, I'm still not happy with my level of productivity when working in Magento and I still regularly come up against significant blockers to getting useful work done. Hopefully this will improve over time.

I have not been as communicative or collaborative within the web team or outside with the marketing team as I would like. I hope to put processes in place to help remedy this going forward.

Ownership / delivery
===

Towards the end of the Arena project I felt significant ownership over it, which led to delivering a quality product on time.

I don't feel the same level of ownership over the web-blinds.com projects or the premier shutters website project.

 (solution - shared goals, openness, collaboration)

Team work
===

I have not been supporting Martin as much as I would like to. I think that collaboration and support within the team is the key to increasing my feeling of ownership over projects, so I hope to be more engaged in the team going forward.

Innovation
===

I think I've delivered in this area - I am good at thinking of new approaches to solve problems and in communicating them to people. I think the effectiveness here could be improved by me having more frequent communication outside my team.

Delivering results
===

I have a good commitment to producing a good product, and I hope I've set an example of code quality. Once again, I think my leadership in this area was better within the Arena project than after it, once again because of a lack of ownership and collaboration within the team. I hope this will be remedied going forward.

Key achievements
===

Learning C# & Umbraco
---

I have successfully learned a lot about C# development, working with Visual studio, Umbraco, and hosting C#-based websites on a Microsoft sever-stack.

Arena website
---

We delivered a solid product on-time, and I had significant input into acheving this goal by working hard to get through the tasks, and helping to refine and manage requirements.

Magento
---

I have learned a lot more about Magento, which is a very complex system. This should help me be a lot more effective in Magento development in the future.

Objectives
===

Morning stand-up
---

I would like to implement more agile team management practices to facilitate collaboration within the team, starting with having stand-ups every morning so everyone can share with the team what they have been and will be working on. I think this will make a big difference.

Communication outside the team
---

I would like to be more proactive at having meetings and discussions with other teams, specifically Heather and the marketing team. I hope to start with a meeting to discuss the nature of the relationship between our team and Heather's as the basis for a healthy working relationship.

Measurement
---

I would like to explore ways to measure my work output and that of the team better, with regular reviews, to continually find ways to improve out process.
