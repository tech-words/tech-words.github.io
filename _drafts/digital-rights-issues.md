Digital Rights Issues
===

I'd like to find positions on digital rights that are as evidence based and neat as Citizen's Income or women's choice.

The Digital Rights issues:

- Transparency vs privacy (Investigative journalism, state secrets, )
- Free speech vs censorship (child porn, hate speech)
- Innovation vs copyright (patents)
- Neutrality & Monopolies (targeted results, advertising, provider privileges - Google are a problem)
  > Is there a natural way to protect against monopolies? Maybe without public trading companies can't grow beyond a certain size... that would be awesome.
