my work at hillarys

Magento
---

I went on a Magento training course for 5 days to learn the object structure etc.

Since then I've been working on Web-blinds.com, doing half the BAU work and I've just started a new project on it. Huge code-base, very complex. Most of my work has been grepping through the code-base and Google trying to work out how to solve problems. Haven't yet got a deep understanding of the architecture.

C#
---

Had to learn C# really fast to take the lean in a new project. Had to choose what technology to use, and design the object structure and set up the environments for testing and live!

Team
---

I had to introduce a load of flaxiblility and reporting to my team. We now have scrums, and we try to break work down into smaller chunks. I've facilitated communication between the different departments, and I've tried to make my devoper more self-sufficient.
