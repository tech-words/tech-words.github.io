The myth of benevolent human nature
==

This topic may well have been done to death. I should probably do a quick search to make sure I'm not writing an exact duplicate blog post.

I think that most people who have strong political ideologigal standpoints (like myself) base those standpoints on what they believe to be fundamental human nature (like myself). For example: I have a strong distrust of free-market capitalism (probably inherited from my step-dad) and so I hold a belief that we humans are, or want to be, more collaborative than competative.

When forming policy, understanding human nature is important. If you're going to define a set of rules for society, you need the people to be able to fit into them. So I suppose what I'm really saying with my "more collaborative than competative" point is that I believe people are more motivated by working together and bouncing ideas off each other than by competing with each other.

Okay, so that probably seems like something of a no-brainer. Here's my main point that just occurred to me:

I think people (including myself) attribute far more to fundamental human nature than they should. And since understanding human nature is so important for the formation of social policy, this is a problem. Mostly this is about morality.

I suppose this would be a classic nature/nurture question. My point is that fundamentally, genetically, it seems logical to me that we would be:

- Aggressive:
  > If we feel threatened or challenged we would respond with fight or flight - this would happen many times a day. Bring modern weapons into the picture and this would mean murder would easily be common.
- Sexually brutish:
  > We would sexually pursue more-or-less anything we wanted when we were horny: animals; other people's children; friends.

My point is, we have to learn how to live and work together. Social morality is entirely learned, none of it is *fundamental*. And there is no doubt that we could not form any kind of society around *fundamental* human nature.

I'm bringing this up because:

These people are vermin. The problem with this is that

I was watching the news with a friend. An MP who was probably Theresa May was speaking about something to do with the recent BBC paedophilia scandal. The government have sanctioned some sort of investigation, and are keen to impress upon everyone how seriously they take it so no-one thinks they're defending the BBC. So Theresa (or someone) was saying something along the lines of "this is shocking and disgusting behaviour". I don't remember the exact wording and I don't want to put words in her (or whoever's) mouth, but the jist I got was that
