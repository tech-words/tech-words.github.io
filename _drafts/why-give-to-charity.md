I'm doing alright for myself.

People don't talk about this much, especially in the UK. But just
so you know, my income is roughly £3k/month. This is well above the
London average (), the national average () and stupidly, shamefully
higher than the global average of £.

Of course, at the same time, many many people are better off than I am.
plenty of people are richer than me.

I don't personally believe this disparity can be morally justified.
