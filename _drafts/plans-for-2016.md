I'm not a huge fan of new year's resolutions. People set themselves lofty goals and then feel bad when they fail to achieve them. Why suddenly attach all your self-worth to whether you succeed in going to the gym every week?

However, the new year is certainly an opportunity for reflection. And this time it's come at just the right moment for me.

I feel stagnant. Professionally, creatively. I need a kick to get back on track. I need to review what I want and what I care about. Thinking about my values [has power][value-power], and choosing focus.
