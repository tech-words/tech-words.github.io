Many recruiters and employers have asked me whether I'm a front- or back-end developer, and I have never given a definite answer, preferring not to leave either behind.

This refusal to pigeonhole myself might well be bad for my career. Some teams definitely like to clearly separate their work into front- and back-end work. And some of my friends do extremely well by becoming specialists in very specific domains.

Should you employ specialists?
===

It's easy to see the attraction of only employing specialists. It's easier to hire people when you know exactly what speciality you're looking for. And if anyone has a difficult involving a particular technology, it's obvious who they should go to ask about it.

However, I think trying to have this level of control over your team can be counter-productive. No piece of work ever involved only one skill. Python developers will clearly need to write HTML and JavaScript sometimes. Also, JavaScript, which is usually considered to be a "front-end" technology, often requires deep understanding of programming design patterns, which would come more naturally to a server-side developer.

Also, specialists will at some point need to interact with people from other domains. At this point it's always helpful if they have some understanding of the other domain. For example, it's now generally accepted that a graphic designer for the web should ideally know something about HTML and CSS, and the DevOps movement is all about increasing interaction between [operations](LINK) and [developers](LINK).

Further, if you have an over-specialised team it is harder to have multiple people who know how to solve a problem. This is firstly a problem if one of them gets hit by a bus, but it also limits the extent to which your team as a whole can grow through skill-sharing, and the extent to which your team members can help each other through problems (for example: through [pair programming](LINK).

Should I specialise?
===

The number one reason why I don't think I should specialise is that **I don't want to**. I find things interesting in all areas of web development and beyond, and this interest motivates me to keep learning. If I were to pigeonhole myself I would quickly become bored, and if I because bored I think I would quickly become pretty bad at my job.

I also think that this diversity of interest means I'm much more likely to be uniquely useful. The unique interaction of all the things I know, which only I will have, provides a unique perspective, and that could mean that I come up with that a solution to a problem that no-one else thought of. It also hopefully means that I can understand the motivations of more of my team members, and so help them out better.

So what are my skills?
===

This still leaves me with an obvious problem - if I haven't specialised, it's difficult for me to explain exactly what I skills are.

Areas of interest
---

I like simple design. I'm not a graphic designer by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm not particularly artistic. However, I am anal about proportions and symmetry. I think I can see elegence and cohesiveness in a design quite well. This helps me to see design like a system, and the goal of that system is to present an intuitive interface to the user. This is a uniquely interesting challenge to me.

My desire for elegance and usability fuels my interest in programming languages. A good programmatic solution will be made as easy as possible for anyone to come to and use or modify. Programming languages themselves are also fascinating from this point of view. A language needs to be able to convey meaning as succinctly and accurately as possible, but while still making it as readable as possible to other people.

In communications technology there are always complex interactions between different systems. There are always many different ways to solve a problem, but some solutions will inherently work better with the given systems than others. I love trying to map out all the possible ways to solve a problem, finding the most efficient way and trying to derive general rules.

I'm interested in human systems too. I love thinking about social structures and interactions between people. I also like thinking of new and more flexible ways to manage projects. People are extremely complex, and projects can be too. It's therefore challenging trying to optimise output, motivation and personal development together within a team and a project.

My skills
---

These interests led me to learn the languages of the web for marking up information and designing web pages (HTML and CSS), and then very quickly on to learning various different programming languages, with different syntaxes and object models (JavaScript, C#, PHP, Ruby, Python). 

I also became interested in technical systems
