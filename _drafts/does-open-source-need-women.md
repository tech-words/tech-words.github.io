Does open-source need women?
===

My interest in gender issues in tech has recently been piqued. I'm scared of writing about it, but at the same time I really want to. This is my first attempt.

Where are the women?

From what I can tell there's a rough consensus that women make up between 15% and 20% of developer positions.
