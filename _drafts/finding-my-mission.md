title: finding my mission
---

I've been obsessed recently with finding my mission. I need drive to feel like I know where I'm going in the world, what I'm trying to achieve. I don't know where to begin. I have a number of basic problems:
- Lack of motivation
- Inability to stick with anything

I am interested in a lot of things:
- Techinical systems
- The internet
- Ease of communication
- Freedom of information
- Democratising eduction
- Democracy in general
- Empowering minority groups (mainly LGBT and Women at the moment - maybe also Indians)
- Criminology


I am interested in systems and interactions. This sounds very abstract, but I think it's the best way to describe it. I'll try to flesh out this idea below.

I am interested in social systems, and I am interested in technical systems. This is not exactly unusual - lost of people are interested in The Internet, and lots of people have opinions about society. I suppose the distinguishing feature is that I'm really interested in the systemic interactions that are going on. I like mapping out interaction paths in my head - for technical systems talking to each other - pieces of software talking to each other in a web stack;
