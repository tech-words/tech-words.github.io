Hillary's economic ideas
===

On Monday, [FiveThirtyEight][] published [an analysis of Hillary Clinton's economic vision][vision].

I really like reading FiveThirtyEight articles. They tend to focus on statistics, which means their articles always feel grounded and balanced. Often they're about topics not that interesting to me, like baseball, but this one is a gem. They explore, with statistics, the political and economic facts and reasoning behind Hillary's political choices.

If you're similarly interested, I suggest you go and read [the article][vision], but I'm also going to summarise it below.

Summary
---

The article mentions the general focus on *raising "incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life"*, and specifically on a handful of Hillary's points:

- "middle-class incomes have stagnated in recent years"
- "economic growth alone doesn’t necessarily translate into more money for the middle class"
- ""
