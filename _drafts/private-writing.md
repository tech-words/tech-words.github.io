I respect openness and I don't feel like I should have anything to hide. Therefore I should be fine with making all my writing open for anyone to read.

But there are two problems with this approach:

1. It's not true. I actually am not okay with anyone reading anything about me. For example, there are certainly things I would worry about my boss reading. I do think ideally I'd have a boss who I have very few secrets from, but still there will be secrets.

2. I will never not be self-conscious about my writing. No matter how okay I am with people knowing things about me, I will always worry that they'll find some reason to judge me in my writing.

For these two reasons, I've decided that private writing is very different from public writing. I will never be able to do the same sort of brutal honesty or soul searching in public writing.

Therefore I need to have a way to write privately. And that means I need to be able to trust that it's private. As I know a fair bit about information security, I think it will take a lot for me to believe that no-one apart from me will ever read what I write. This has not been a problem for me so far because I don't have that much to hide, but if I'm going to start private writing I really need to make absolutely sure it is private.

I suspect this means encrypting it immediately, and only decrypting it at the point when I want to read it. It needs a password that only I know and that I never download anywhere, and that is too strong for even a local brute-force attack.

I'm going to need to look into this.

However, once I've succeeded in creating a private space that no-one will ever be able to access apart from me, I think it will be quite therapeutic to try out writing just for myself.
