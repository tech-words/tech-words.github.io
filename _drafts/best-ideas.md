## The best ideas in the world

Some ideas are just objectively good.

I'm not talking about complex concepts that only geniuses could visualize,
I'm talking about simple ideas that everyone could and probably has thought of.

These are ideas would definitely make the world better for almost everyone in
it. They are ideas that we should be constantly striving towards. They
should transcend petty arguments about human political or financial systems.
Instead, these should be the measures by which we decide if a human systems
are succeeding or failing.

#### 1. Knowledge should be freely available to anyone

#### 2. Machines & automation should mean we all work less

#### 3. Everyone should have enough to live

#### 4. No-one should have more wealth than they could ever hope to spend while others starve

#### 5.
