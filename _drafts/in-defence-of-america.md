In defense of America
===

I just returned from my first ever visit to the east coast of the USA, and it's given me a different perspective on ["the greatest nation on earth"][].

Among my more left-wing friends, [the United States of America][] is something of a laughing stock. It is often employed in discussion as a prime example of how *not* to run a society. This is for many reasons:

The USA have by far the [highest incarceration rate][] in the developed world, with [almost 1 in 100 people in prison][] (and 1 in 10 black men), and they remain the only "first world" nation to [retain the death penalty][]. Gun control laws are [shockingly weak][], and as a result the country suffers mass shootings [with alarming regularity][]. [Corporate capture][] pervades all branches of government, creating a fertile legislative environment for large corporations. This has led to an abysmal [social support system][], and [relatively few protections for employees][], as well some [unhealthy monopolies][], and led to America's [developed-world-leading inequality][]. This has resulted in rates of [obesity][], [life expectancy][], [literacy][], [child mortality][] and [mental health problems][], as well as [broadband speeds][] and [a private health service][] which lag well behind much of the developed world.

The country has the [largest military][] and the greatest [number of nuclear weapons][] in the entire world by a large margin - and remain the only nation in history to [use a nuke against a civilian population][]. They have a history of [invading countries][] for [dubious reasons][] and [torturing "some folks"][]. Under [president Obama][] the CIA significantly expanded its [drone program][] resulting in quite a few [extra-judicial killings][] including many [civilian casualties][]. Overall, the USA have a [human-rights record][] to arguably rival [China][] in its brutality.

All this may be particularly surprising given not only that the USA continually brands itself [the greatest nation on earth][], but also because they are [quite definitely the richest][].

So how can I argue in defence of such a place?

- Social indicators aren't all there is to life - inspiration. stories, creativity
- Oldest democracy (FACTCHECK) - wrestling with freedoms of speech and personal autonomy

- Great stories
- Great ideals
- Place of innovation and ideas:
  > Nobel laureats
  > NASA
  > Music
  > Hollywood
- Leading in many thing:
  > Marriage equality
  > Higher education
  > Freedom of speech

...

In recent years, the USA population appears to be finally waking up to the possibility that America might just not be the greatest country in the world.
