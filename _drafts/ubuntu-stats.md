Ubuntu stats
===

For all stats, I've looked at percentages over the year to 31st Jan, and compared them to the same period over the previous year.

- 2nd most peope from India (add percentage)
  - In order: USA, India, Germany, China, UK, Brazil
  - Percentage of traffic from all emerging markets has risen over the last year as compared to "western" traffic:
    - China up 1%, USA down 0.8%, India up 0.1%, Germany down 0.3%, Brazil up 0.5%, UK down 0.2%
- 11% visitors are women (according to Google demographics)
  - Dropped 0.5% over the last year
  - How do Google know? Where does this come from? Does it exclude countries? Could they be lying?
