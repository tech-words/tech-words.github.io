- "Recognition rather than recall"
  - Clear menu, always visible
  - Avoid hover states which hide parts of the page
- "Flexibility and efficincy of use"
  - Clear & forgiving URL structure, to make URLs hackable
  - Offer several list views, so users can view by tag. But never rely on this for normal users
- "Aesthetic & minimal design"
  - Minimal design, lots of whitespace, nothing we don't need
  - Mobile-first
  - Fade-in background content?
  - Put important stuff first and forefront
- "Recover from errors"
