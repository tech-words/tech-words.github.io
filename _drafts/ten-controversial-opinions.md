1. Women of any age should have the right to have a private abortion at any time during their pregnancy
===

People can argue forever over this trimester or that trimester. People turn to science, but it actually can't help us solve the issue.

I believe that while a foetus is inside a women, it is ultimately her right to abort it if she wishes.

2. Nobody ever *deserves* to be punished
===

Literally nobody. Murderers, perpetrators of war crimes, poedofiles, rapists, child pornographers, torturers, even [bankers][behindbars].

I believe 

3. Anybody should be allowed to say anything they like without fear of retribution
===

4. Equality should be the golden rule of social policy
===

5. All earnings in society should be entirely transparent and public domain
===

6. Patents shouldn't exist
===

7. No law or piece of legislature should discriminate based on gender or sexuality
===

This means:
- same sex marriages
- 

8. State should be separate from religion
===

9. Something about children and exposure to material?
