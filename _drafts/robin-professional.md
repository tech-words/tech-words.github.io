I am a [web developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer).

Interests
===

I am excited by The Internet.

I enjoy creating class structures to be easily maintainable and extendible. I like critically analysing design patterns and principles of software design, and enjoy thinking about levels of abstraction and the way layers interact within an application. I like designing APIs based on RESTful principles (within reason) and statelessness.

I like functional designs and love usability. I enjoy creating simple, intuitive and responsive designs. I love creating neat and flexible web pages that work efficiently on any interface.

I love the Agile manifesto. I'm interested in modern radical methods for managing projects and people. I value small self-managed teams, short and regular meetings and pair-programming. I believe in striving for friendly, flexible and diverse work environments with a truly no-blame culture. I want to champion transparency, experimentation and continuous improvement.

I like optimising web applications and work-flows. I enjoy configuring environments and servers for rapid and frequent releases. I like designing branching models for version control.

I believe in the power of The Internet to facilitate open and transparent information flow for the great advantage of all of mankind. I believe strongly in freedom of speech and information. I strongly believe in sharing achievements and building on each other's work. I love open source software and creative commons licenses. I despise aggressive patent litigation and dislike proprietary interfaces and corporate secrets.
