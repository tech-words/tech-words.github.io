I just made this PHP class. It's extremely simple and easy to use for
anyone who knows the slightest bit about PHP - I hope.

[https://github.com/nottrobin/PHP-Mailer](https://github.com/nottrobin/PHP-Mailer)

I needed to send lots of emails, but have it look like I'd sent each one
individually. I had a search, and there were ZERO online services to
help me do it - which surprised me a little - and lots of code snippets
to help you do it, but nothing really comprehensive.

This is why I've written this. Feel free to use it. I just used it and
it worked a treat.
