The Symfony 2 [standard project](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) suggests that you install it in [one of two ways](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/900fc9d3cafa06a4b6d023b99d5e75fffaf74fe1/README.md#1-installing-the-standard-edition):

- Install it using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) (which will retrieve the version that's on [packigist](https://packagist.org/))
- Download as an [archive](http://symfony.com/download) from the [symfony website](http://symfony.com/)

However, as I'm a developer, I'm used to using github, and I don't need the code-base to be particularly stable at the moment - I chose a third option:

- Installing from a fork of the Symfony 2 standard project

The danger of forking the actual repository is that it might not be stable. There could be unfixed bugs that aren't in the official releases. The advantage is that it's particularly easy to pull in new changes from the Symfony repository.

## The environment

I'm doing all this on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Raring Ringtail (13.04). This post will almost certainly work in a similar way for any modern debian-based OS, but it will be fairly useless for yum-based OSes, and completely useless for Windows.

## Install packages

Before we start, you'll need a [github](https://github.com/) account, and you'll need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [php5-cli](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/php5-cli), [php5-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/php5-dev), [php5-mysql](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/php5-mysql), [php5-intl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/php5-intl) and [php-apc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/php-apc) on your local computer:

``` bash
# Install packages
$ sudo apt-get install git php5-cli php5-dev mysql-server php5-mysql php5-intl php-apc
```

## Configuration tweaks

We must make sure that `date.timezone` is set to a [valid timezone](http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.europe.php). Symfony recommends that we set `short_open_tag` to `Off`, so we might as well change that at the same time:

``` ini
; /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

[php]
; around line 213
; change the value to "off"
short_open_tag = Off

[Date]
; around line 876
; uncomment and change value
date.timezone = Europe/London
```

Symfony also recommends that we set XDebug to allow a high nesting level:

``` bash
# Add to PHP configuration      
$ echo "xdebug.max_nesting_level=250" | sudo tee -a /etc/php5/mods-available/xdebug.ini
```

And that MySQL is set to UTF-8 by default:

``` ini
; /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[mysqld]
; around line 30
; add these new keys
collation-server = utf8_general_ci
character-set-server = utf8
```

## Fork the repository

[Forking a github repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) is as easy as navigating to the [repository page](https://github.com/nottrobin/symfony-standard) and clicking the "fork" button. Note down the URL for your repository and clone it and change to the directory, e.g.:

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/symfony-standard.git
$ cd symfony-standard
```

## Install dependencies and configure

Now you'll need `composer` to install dependencies:

``` bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```
When it prompts you for input, you'll probably want to leave most things as default (blank), except the database password for `root` user if you set one:

``` bash
Some parameters are missing. Please provide them.
database_driver (pdo_mysql):
database_host (127.0.0.1):
database_port (null):
database_name (symfony):
database_user (root):
database_password (null):<yourRootDbPassword>
mailer_transport (smtp):
mailer_host (127.0.0.1):
mailer_user (null):
mailer_password (null):
locale (en):en-gb
secret (ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt):somesecretkeyorother
```

Now you can commit your [`composer.lock`](http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file) into your repository fork to make sure your dependency versions stay reliable:

``` bash
$ git add composer.lock
$ git commit -m 'Add composer.lock: dependency versions'
```

## Check everything works

Now hopefully if you run the check, you'll see a long list of "OK"s:

``` bash
$ php ./app/check.php
```

```
********************************
*                              *
*  Symfony requirements check  *
*                              *
********************************
...
 OK       PHP version must be at least 5.3.3 (5.4.9-4ubuntu2 installed)
 OK       PHP version must not be 5.3.16 as Symfony won't work properly with it
 OK       Vendor libraries must be installed
... etc
```

If you get `error`s you must fix them. If you get `warning`s feel free to ignore them.

### Create the database

You can now, if you want, use Doctrine to create the database:

``` bash
php app/console doctrine:database:create
```

### Run the PHP server

If the PHP version listed in the output of `check.php` is at least `5.4` (see above, mine is `5.4.9-4ubuntu2`) then you can run the PHP server. [You can update](http://askubuntu.com/questions/109404/how-do-i-install-latest-php-in-supported-ubuntu-versions-like-5-4-x-in-ubuntu-1) to `5.4` if you don't have it already.

``` bash
$ php ./app/console server:run
```

And then browse to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
