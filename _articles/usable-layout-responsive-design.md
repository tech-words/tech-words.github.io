I originally wrote this post in June 2010 on my Wordpress blog. I like to think it was before the internet caught onto the idea of responsive design. I'm now re-posting it on Tumblr (My wordpress has beenÂ decommissioned).

I was playing around with "usable layout" as I called it, the main features being:

 - The main content area is the right width for easy reading (set in "em"s) - see [this article](http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/)
 - Right and left columns wrap to above/below the main content when there is no longer space for them

Here are my initial designs:

I've since made other designs that follow the same idea:
