(Also posted [on design.canonical.com][aa27f6b4])

I routinely have at least 20 tabs open in Chrome, 10 files open in
[Atom][e107dbd4] (my editor of choice) and I'm often running virtual machines
as well. This means my poor little [X1 Carbon][fbd87bd9] often runs out of
memory, at which point Ubuntu completely freezes up, preventing me from doing
anything at all.

Just a few days ago I had written a long post which I lost completely when my
system froze, because Atom [doesn't yet][ea6f49f0] recover documents after
crashes.

If this sounds at all familiar to you, **I now have a solution**! (Although
it didn't save me in this case because it needs to be enabled first - see
below.)

## oom_kill

The [magic SysRq key][95cedafa] can run a bunch of kernel-level commands.
One of these commands is called `oom_kill`. OOM stands for "Out of memory",
so `oom_kill` will kill the process taking up the most memory, to free some up.
In most cases this should unfreeze [Ubuntu][7b2ffc42].

You can run `oom_kill` from the keyboard with the following shortcut:

```
# Kill the process taking up the most memory
alt + SysRq + f
```

Except that this is disabled by default on Ubuntu:

# Enabling SysRq functions

For [security reasons][a957abbb], SysRq keyboard functions are disabled by
default. To [enable them][55eb561d], change the value in the file
`/etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf` to `1`:

```
# /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf
kernel.sysrq = 1
```

And to enable the new config run:

``` bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

# SysRq shortcut for the Thinkpad X1

Most laptops don't have a physical `SysRq` key. Instead they offer a keyboard
combination to emulate the key. On my Thinkpad, this is `fn + s`. However, there's
a quirk that the `SysRq` key is only "pressed" when you release.

So to run `oom_kill` on a Thinkpad, after enabling it, do the following:

- Press and hold `alt`
- To emulate `SysRq`, press `fn` and `s` keys together, then release them  (keep holding `alt`)
- Press `f`

This will kill the most expensive process (usually the browser tab running
`inbox.google.com` in my case), and freeup some memory.

Now, if your computer ever freezes up, you can just do this, and hopefully fix
it.
