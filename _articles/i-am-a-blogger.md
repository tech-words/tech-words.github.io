title: I am a blogger
description: Building a daily writing habit

This is my first post since 5th February 2019.

That's 21 months.

My determination to write has only increased over time, as my output has massively reduced. It's a strange paradox. I've been frustrated by it for a long time.

A few months ago I realised that what I really needed was a daily writing habit. I need to get away from imagining writing massive ground-breaking perfect articles, and instead just write. Exercise that muscle.

But still, I've been procrastinating. First I redesigned my site (more on that soon). Then I started looking for blogging communities to support me. Then I watched some videos about how to write blog articles. I tried to set up AdSense (just to see how much I could make). And on and on.

Then tonight I watched [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3vRK2P9lSU) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9uDVVWN_ZE&t=2575s) about self discipline which were really helpful, and gave me one key takeaway:

The key to being disciplined as a blogger is for me to believe that I am a blogger.

And now, just like that, I am a blogger. And bloggers blog. Every day.

This will be my first post in a long time, and hopefully the first of many, many short and boring posts just like this one.

Wish me luck, and self-belief!
