I've been thinking about depression recently.

Although I've never had to take antidepressants, I was depressed at university and my grades suffered. At its worst I missed an exam because I couldn't get out of bed. I'm generally much better now, although in some sense it will always be a part of me.

I find depression is very interesting. Everyone will experience it differently, but it's always complex and deep. I am also always impressed by people with the self-awareness and courage to write honestly about their experience.

Below are three of my favourite stories of depression.

## Andrew Solomon: Depression, the secret we share

This video appeared on TED.com this month. Andrew tells stories of his experience and that of people he's known, and discusses just how common depression is:

### "The Inner World" by Emily Dickinson

This is the poem that is read at the start of the above video:

> I felt a funeral in my brain,  
>  And mourners, to and fro,  
> Kept treading, treading, till it seemed  
>  That sense was breaking through.
>
> And when they all were seated,  
>  A service like a drum  
> Kept beating, beating, till I thought  
>  My mind was going numb.
>
> And then I heard them lift a box,  
>  And creak across my soul  
> With those same boots of lead,  
>  Then space began to toll
>
> As all the heavens were a bell,  
>  And Being but an ear,  
> And I and silence some strange race,  
>  Wrecked, solitary, here.
>
> And then a plank in reason, broke,  
>  And I dropped down and down--  
> And hit a world at every plunge,  
>  And finished knowing--then--

## Allie's story (from Hyperbole and a Half)

This is Allie's illustrated story of her own depression. It might be the first story of depression I read in full. I think it's so fantastically well-put and illustrated.

## Depression quest (game)

This is a text-based, in-browser adventure game by Zoe Quinn where you play someone suffering from depression. I think it's really quite effective at communicating what it's like to have depression.

[Play Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/)

When Zoe [submitted Depression Quest to Steam's Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200770535) she apparently [suffered some online abuse](http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/12/13/harassment-depression-quests-developer-depressing/) from people who didn't like the game, which is a shame. If you like it, please [go and vote for it](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200770535).
