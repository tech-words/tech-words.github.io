I feel like I've been having a lot of arguments with companies lately.

On Tuesday I bought an iPad from [PhotoDirect on eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=photodirect) as a birthday present for my girlfriend and on Wednesday it arrived (wonderful service).

## iPad browsing problems

However, then we realised that my girlfriend's core online learning resource - [e-learning for healthcare](http://e-lfh.org.uk)

- doesn't work on an iPad (incidentally it works fine on [Jelly Bean](http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/) but that's another story).

## Returning an iPad

So on Friday (2 days after it arrived) I sent an eBay message to PhotoDirect asking to return the item, polite as you like:

> hi. I just bought a white iPad 2 from you. it arrived on Wednesday.  
> it was a present for my girlfriend, but she's discovered that the main thing she wanted to do on it it won't work for.  
> can I send it back and get a full refund? the packaging hasn't been opened.
>
> -- <cite>nottrobin</cite>

Anticipating a struggle, as soon as I sent this message I googled and read up on my consumer rights.

They responded:

> Thank you for contacting us.  
> Is it still as we sent? Sealed?
>
> -- <cite>photodirect</cite>

(Ignore that I'd clearly said "the packaging hasn't been opened" - this isn't the point)

## Misunderstandings

This is where I communicated terribly:

> I opened the outer cardboard box. the actual iPad packaging is untouched and still in it's cellophane wrapping.
>
> -- <cite>nottrobin</cite>

I can see from my second reply there that she might have thought I had opened the iPad's manufacturer box (I hadn't),
which led to...

## The part where they try to steal £10

> Thank you for contacting us.
> When you broke the seal , we can't sell it as Brand new again so we can refund your payment minus 10GBP .
>
> -- <cite>photodirect</cite>

I just want to clarify that In may case there is absolutely no cause for them
to complain because I didn't actually open the manufacturer box. This is a matter of principle.

Here is where it gets interesting / infuriating. They just **broke the law**:

> .. the UK Distance Selling Regulations state that you must allow me to return the item for a full refund, even if I have opened it (with exceptions that don't included iPads) - I have the right to inspect the item and still cancel the order if I wish.
>
> -- <cite>nottrobin</cite>

## Consumer rights - the Distance Selling Regulations

I think this point is really important. The [UK Distance Selling Regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2334/contents/made) mean that:

> Your right to cancel starts the moment you place your order and doesn’t end until seven working days from the day after you receive your goods.
>
> -- <cite>[Which?](http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/distance-selling-regulations/#link-2)</cite>

This right means that you can inspect a product exactly as you would expect to be able to in a shop

- and **that means opening the package** - and still send it back for a full refund.

## Further attempts to infringe on consumer rights

Once I'd got them to agree to give me a refund, they sent me an email containing instructions on how to send it back to them.
This email contained the following:

> .. Please make sure that the item does not have any physical or user related damage.
> Any problems related to user fault will be refused.
>
> -- <cite>photodirect</cite>

Once again, this threat is **against the law**. As shown above,
a distance retailer **does not have the right** to refuse to give me a
refund as long as I wish to cancel the order within 7 days of receiving it:

> .. even if the customer fails to take reasonable care of the goods, they still have a right to cancel and receive a full refund.
> However, you may have a claim for damages against them.

## This is important

Fortunately for me I am the sort of person who will look up my rights in situations like this.

Lots of other people don't have the time or the inclination,
and probably the socially dis-empowered are the least likely to do so.

In this situation, photodirect could have got away with stealing from them by not giving them a full refund.
That is why I think this is important, and why I think this was particularly disgusting behaviour on the part of photodirect.
