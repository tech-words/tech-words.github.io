## Foreword

This is a full repost of the article by Daily Mail columnist [Richard Littlejohn](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/columnist-322/Richard-Littlejohn.html) that's been receiving
[so](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2013/mar/22/richard-littlejohn-transgender)
[much](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/22/death-of-trans-teacher-lucy-meadows-prompts-calls-for-daily-mail-to-sack-richard-littlejohn/)
[attention](http://action.sumofus.org/a/daily-mail-littlejohn-lucy-meadows/?akid=1444.355122.uMui_E&rd=1&sub=fwd&t=1).

### Why repost?

The Daily Mail have since removed the article and redirected its URL to a different article.

I believe in open and uncensored access to information, even for controversial content, and since I found it so hard to find the contents of this article (I eventually found [it on archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html)), I'm reposting it here to help someone else find it.

### My position

In case you're interested in my position on the whole thing: I completely disagree with Littlejohn's position against transgender teachers, but I also believe in his right to express his opinion - he wasn't overly offensive or vitriolic. I think it's extremely unfortunate that Lucy Meadows committed suicide and I feel very sorry for Lucy Meadows but also for Richard Littlejohn who's life must be horrible right now.

Without further ado, here's the article (minus images and captions), pasted from [archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html)

## The article

> He's not only in the wrong body... he's in the wrong job

> Look, it can't be much fun being a woman trapped in a man's body. Believe me, ladies, there are times when it's not exactly a bundle of laughs being a man trapped inside a man's body.

> So I have every sympathy for the 400 or so people a year who opt for 'gender reassignment' surgery to put themselves out of their misery.

> I don't even have any problem with sex-change operations being carried out on the NHS, provided it's a genuine medical necessity and not a lifestyle choice. Transsexuals pay taxes, too.

> Schoolteacher Nathan Upton, 32, says he always knew he was born into the wrong sex. Yet he married and fathered a child, now aged three. It was only fairly recently that he decided to go public with his inner turmoil.

> The first indications came when he began growing his cropped hair and dyeing it purple. He started turning up for class wearing pink nail varnish and sparkly headbands.

> His pupils at St Mary Magdalen's Church of England Primary School in Accrington, Lancs, couldn't help noticing. A crayon drawing of Mr Upton by a Year 6 pupil on the school's website shows him with long hair swept back over his shoulders.

> One parent said: 'I saw what I thought was Mr Upton dressed as a woman in town one weekend, but I decided I had imagined it.'

> Oh no, you hadn't.

> Confirmation came in the school's Christmas newsletter. It started innocuously enough, with a series of routine staff announcements. Then in paragraph six, out of the blue, BOOM! Are you sitting comfortably, children?

> 'Mr Upton has made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman after the Christmas break. She will return to work as Miss Meadows.'

> It went on to stress that the school is 'proud of our commitment to equality and diversity'. Of course they are.

> This week, the school's 169 pupils, aged between seven and 11, were informed class-by-class that from now on, 'Sir' would be 'Miss'.

> Teachers told them that Mr Upton felt he had been 'born with a girl's brain in a boy's body' and would henceforth be living as a woman.

> Nathan Upton is now in the early stages of gender reassignment treatment. He issued a statement which read: 'This has been a long and difficult journey for me and it was certainly not an easy decision to make.'

> So that's all right, then. From now on, kiddies, Mr Upton will be known as Miss Lucy Meadows.

> What are you staring at, Johnny? Move along, nothing to see here. Get on with your spelling test. Today's word is 'transitioning'.

> Mr Upton/Miss Meadows may well be comfortable with his/her decision to seek a sex-change and return to work as if nothing has happened. The school might be extremely proud of its 'commitment to equality and diversity'.

> But has anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren't equipped to compute this kind of information.

> Pre-pubescent boys and girls haven't even had the chance to come to terms with the changes in their own bodies.

> Why should they be forced to deal with the news that a male teacher they have always known as Mr Upton will henceforth be a woman called Miss Meadows? Anyway, why not Miss Upton?

> Parent Wayne Cowie said the news had left his ten-year-old son worried and confused.

> For the past three years he has been taught by Mr Upton, but has now been told that he will be punished if he continues to call 'Miss Meadows' 'Mr Upton' after the Christmas holidays. 'My middle boy thinks that he might wake up with a girl's brain because he was told that Mr Upton, as he got older, got a girl's brains.'

> The school shouldn't be allowed to elevate its 'commitment to diversity and equality' above its duty of care to its pupils and their parents.

> It should be protecting pupils from some of the more, er, challenging realities of adult life, not forcing them down their throats.

> These are primary school children, for heaven's sake. Most them still believe in Father Christmas. Let them enjoy their childhood. They will lose their innocence soon enough.

> The head teacher denies that pupils will be punished for referring to the teacher as Mr Upton but added ominously that they would be 'expected to behave properly around her.' Nathan Upton is entitled to his gender reassignment surgery, but he isn't entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.

> By insisting on returning to St Mary Magdalen's, he is putting his own selfish needs ahead of the well-being of the children he has taught for the past few years.

> It would have been easy for him to disappear quietly at Christmas, have the operation and then return to work as 'Miss Meadows' at another school on the other side of town in September. No-one would have been any the wiser.

> But if he cares so little for the sensibilities of the children he is paid to teach, he's not only trapped in the wrong body, he's in the wrong job.
