Today was [Deepavali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali) (or Diwali) - the first for my son, and the first that my Daughter was properly engaged with. It was great, and exhausting.

I now have this commitment to publish a post every day on this blog, and I don't want to break it so early on, but I really don't have the energy to write some tech article or anything. So today it's just going to be this modest diary entry.

I think this is a good thing for me to publish, because it sets the bar low.

As I [mentioned](/2020/11/13/i-am-a-blogger/), I've really struggled with overcoming some block preventing me from writing blog posts, even though I really want to. I think this is a complex of perfectionism. I put way too much pressure on myself for each article, for it to be as perfect as I could possibly imagine.

This is impossible to achieve.

So for the time being, my task it to lower the bar for myself. Stop expecting my posts to be perfect, or even good. Write a lot, publish a lot, and be fine with what I publish being very low quality most of the time.

Case in point. Goodnight.
