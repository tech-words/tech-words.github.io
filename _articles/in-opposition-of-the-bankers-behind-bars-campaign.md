Avaaz recently ran a campaign called "[bankers behind bars](http://www.avaaz.org/en/bankers_behind_bars_g/)". While I
agree with many Avaaz campaigns, this particular one goes against
everything I believe in. I sent them an email.

Actually my email purports to be offering some suggestions for adding
credibility to Avaaz campaigns, which is something I genuinely think,
but I admit it was just a frame for my opposition to the one campaign.

> To start with the effect of Avaaz petitions was powerful because you
> could amass hundreds of thousands, or sometimes millions, of signatures
> on an issue.

> However, as time goes on more and more of these petitions exist, and now
> 100k signatures on an online petition isn't anything impressive.

> Ways in which you could show just how important certain petitions are to
> people include:

> - Having a page comparing how quickly signatures were generated for the different petitions, to see which perform better.
> - Allowing people to vote either way in a petition, so you can see how many Avaaz members actually disagree with a petition.

> For example, while I support most of Avaaz's campaigns, and I am as
> staunch a supporter of financial reform as you're likely to find, I
> cannot condone pushing for bankers to be imprisoned. This goes against
> everything I believe in. By all means shine a light on the practices in
> banks and shame those involved and make sure they never are in a
> position to cause such harm again. Examine the causes of the toxic
> culture and regulate against it. That would all be wonderful.

> BUT what will seeking to punish those involved with imprisonment
> achieve? They don't need to be imprisoned for the protection of society,
> as making sure they are not allowed to be bankers any more is not a
> difficult thing to achieve, so punishment can be the only goal.

> Imprisoning Bob Diamond may scare other banking bosses into being
> slightly more responsible with our money (although I'm not convinced 
> that's necessarily true) but do you really want to encourage defining 
> society through fear? The real solution to the banking crisis is through 
> regulation, transparency and promoting a culture of equality, not through 
> punishing the constituents of the broken system.

> Sorry went off on a bit of a tangent there. The bottom line is - I would
> have more respect for Avaaz as an organisation if there was a mechanism
> whereby, as an Avaaz member, I could express my opposition to a
> campaign.

> Kind regards,
