The longer I live in the digital world, the more clearer it becomes that it doesn't have much structure. I have yet to settle on any solid strategy for organising information that actually makes it easy to find important things that I saw in the past. Everywhere I store things is bottomless pits of information.

Similarly, finding new information is increasingly hard. Although it definitely had its drawbacks, I long for the days when I would read a single newspaper, or my university professors might indicate to me what I should read. The plurality of information out there nowadays is incredibly hard to sort through.
