Today again I don't have time for an in-depth piece. In fact, I might consider letting myself off [the hook](https://robinwinslow.uk/2020/11/13/i-am-a-blogger/) on weekends, but I'm not going to make that choice yet.

Instead, today I'm simply going to write down some of the posts I hope to write in the next few days.

These posts will all form a larger story about how I created the new styling for my blog.

1. *What's the point of this site?* - Lay out the goals of my blog, and the principles behind how I run it
2. *Shooting for simplicity* - My philosophy for creating a simple user experience for my blog
3. *Go big or go home: On font size and spacing*
4. *Why is everything centre-aligned?*

This will do for now. I'm not hard committing to any of the titles here, but they're just the beginnings of the direction I want to take with my next few posts.

I have a much longer list of post ideas, but I won't bore us both with them all right now.

Good night.
