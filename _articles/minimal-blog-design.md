title: A minimal blog
description: Why and how I created a minimalistic new style for this site
published: false

My blog has been neglected for years, dispite my strong desire to write more. The psychological barrier here has been the pressure I put on myself to make all my work _significant_.

To combat this tendency, I'm reinventing my blog with minimalism at its heart. I'll write short, quick, unpretentious articles that don't say much and don't expect much in return.

But before I do that, I've decided my new blog needs a new design, in keeping with this minimal concept.

### Minimal design

I've been a fan of simplicity in tech for as long as I can remember. Complexity is costly, and most things are far too complicated.

##### Implications

Every time I'm implementing things, I don't accept complexity. If I don't understand why I'm doing things, I go back to basics until I understand it. Then I build it up from the ground up keeping it as lean as possible.
