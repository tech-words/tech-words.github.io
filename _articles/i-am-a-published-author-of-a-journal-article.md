Woop!

I just had [a paper](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2012.723140) published in the [Taylor &amp; Francis](http://www.tandfonline.com/) [Ergonomics](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/terg20) journal.

It's called "Micro-generation schemes: user behaviours and attitudes towards energy consumption".

[Buy it from Taylor &amp; Francis](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00140139.2012.723140)

or

[Download it for free](http://resources.robinwinslow.uk/documents/StedmonWinslowLangley.pdf) from my server (am I allowed to do this?)

Enjoy :)
